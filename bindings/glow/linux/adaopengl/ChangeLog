   * Makefile:
   Fixed some more GNAE bugs, this specification is rather vague =(.

   * opengl.ads,
     opengl-glfw.ads,
     opengl-glx.ads,
     opengl-wgl.ads:
   Fixed tons of bugs in the GLFW binding.
   More work on the WGL binding.
   Synced gl.h, glx.h and glext.h with Mesa CVS.

   * Makefile,
     opengl-glfw.ads,
     opengl-wgl.ads:
   Added opengl-wgl.ads again.
   Wrote a GLFW binding.

   * Makefile:
   Made the install GNAE compatible.

   * opengl.ads,
     opengl-glut.ads,
     opengl-glu.ads,
     opengl-ext.ads:
   Allow OpenGL pointers to access aliased variables.
   Fixed a lot of style errors.
   Build dynamic library and added install/uninstall target.

   * opengl.ads,
     opengl-glut.ads,
     opengl-glu.ads,
     opengl-ext.ads:
   First update in a while. I'm swamped with schoolwork at the moment =(.
   Just fixed a ton of style errors (started using -gnaty in my Ada
   project =).

TAG: ADAOPENGL_0_9
2003-01-11  David Holm  <david@realityrift.com>
	* opengl.ads,
	  opengl-glut.ads:
	Made it possible to use Ada's null when passing a NULL to a gl* function.
	Fixed a few last bugs in OpenGL.GLUT.

2003-01-06  David Holm  <david@realityrift.com>
	* opengl-glu.ads,
	  opengl-glx.ads,
	  opengl.ads:
	Removed all (?) access variables to functions and procedures and replaced
	them with GL*Ptr. This will make it easier in case you want to convert
	these to use Interfaces.C.Pointers in the future.
	Also got the adaxgl example working thanks to Guillaume Foliard
	<guifo@wanadoo.fr> who found the problem. It will require a patched version
	of AdaBindX 0.7.2 to work (as there was a type missing in it). Hopefully
	we will get this into the next AdaBindX release unless they object.

2003-01-04  David Holm  <david@realityrift.com>
	* opengl-glut.ads,
	  opengl.ads:
	Added stronger typing.

2003-01-03  David Holm  <david@realityrift.com>
	* opengl-glut.ads
	  opengl-ext.ads,
	  opengl-glu.ads,
	  opengl-glx.ads,
	  opengl.ads:
	Updated (c) information.
	Finished mapping callback functions to glut, though it is still broken.

2002-12-31  David Holm  <david@realityrift.com>
	* opengl-glut.ads,
	  opengl-ext.ads,
	  opengl-glu.ads,
	  opengl-glx.ads,
	  opengl.ads:
	Removed all the overloaded functions using System.Address since you can
	use 'Unchecked_Access on an aliased variable instead. Thanks goes to
	Joachim Schröer.
	Added opengl-glut.ads, but it's still untested (example coming).

TAG: ADAOPENGL_0_1

	* opengl-ext.ads,
	  opengl-glu.ads,
	  opengl-glx-ext.ads,
	  opengl-glx.ads,
	  opengl.ads:
	These are based on MesaLib 5.0. glext.h (opengl-ext.ads) is from SGI and
	not part of MesaLib.
	All procedures and functions that take access variables have an overloaded
	counterpart which takes System.Address, this way you can send a function
	GLNULL or an aliased array. I'm hoping I will have time to write a thick
	binding which will conform more to the Ada95 standard than this thin
	binding does.
