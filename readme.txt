Welcome to GLOBE_3D, the GL Object Based Engine for 3D in Ada.

Please refer to GLOBE_3D_Info.html for the documentation!

  |  If you are really in a hurry, skip the documentation page,
  |  go to the demo directory and pick an appropriate project file...
  |  
  |      globe_3d_demos.gpr     (GNAT, valid at least for Windows and Linux;
  |                                there is an untested mode for Mac)
  |      globe_3d_objectada.prj (ObjectAda 9.1+ project file)
  |      globe_3d_darwin.gpr    (old GNAT project file for Mac; perhaps
  |                                globe_3d_demos.gpr is OK for Mac)
  |  
  |  ...punch "Build", then run globe_3d_demo[.exe] (Windows: not from
  |  GNAT Studio, but directly from an Explorer window).
