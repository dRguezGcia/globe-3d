Welcome to GLOBE_3D, the GL Object Based Engine for 3D in Ada.

Please refer to GLOBE_3D_Info.html for the documentation!

If you are really in a hurry, skip the documentation page,
go to the demo directory and pick an appropriate project file:

  globe_3d_demos.gpr     (GNAT, valid at least for Windows and Linux; untested mode for Mac)
  globe_3d_objectada.prj (ObjectAda 9.1+ project file)
  globe_3d_darwin.gpr    (old GNAT project file for Mac; perhaps globe_3d_demos.gpr is OK)

The upload's date appear in the _Upload_version_[date].txt file.
